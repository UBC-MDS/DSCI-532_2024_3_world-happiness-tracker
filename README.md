# Purpose:
We aim to develop a dashboard that visually represents the global happiness score as well as the happiness scores of various countries and regions. This dashboard will be useful for educational purposes across multiple fields where the happiness score can prove to be beneficial. These fields include, but are not limited to, economics, sociology, and psychology.
