# World Happiness Tracker App Dashboard Reflection

All of the features in our proposal have been implemented, with some of them being slightly different than our initial designs. We initially proposed 3 key metrics at the top that are invariable regardless of which year is selected. However, we now believe that it would be helpful for the user to see the information of the year they selected, hence why we have now made the key metrics dynamic to the year filter. Additionally, we believe that showing the gap between the highest and the lowest countries in terms of the happiness score would be an interesting and useful statistic, and therefore, we have added this as another key metric on top of the three originally proposed. In contrast to the initial design, the filters now appear on top of these key metrics since they now affect all components of the dashsboard, including the key metrics.

The map remains unchanged from our initial design, showing the happiness score for each country, and is also subject to the change of years. Another major change we made was the position of the ranking table. The table initially was planned to be below the map and alongside two other charts, but because of its size, we have moved it to the right of the map for better readability. Moreover, in the original data, some of the countries are only included in the data of certain years. We have decided to drop these countries that are not part of the data for all the years for better implementation of the filters without unexpected behavior. As a result, there are certain years where countries of a certain rank (e.g., rank 105) do not exist. We have decided to collapse the data by re-ranking the countries accordingly to smooth out the gaps.

The user is allowed to select either one or two countries at a time. When no country is selected, the table shows the top 10 countries for the selected year. When either 1 or 2 countries are selected, the countries will be displayed along with the 3 happiest and 3 unhappiest countries of the selected year to show comparison.

Finally, the line plot showing the score over the years and the bar plot showing factors contributing to happiness remain the same from our original proposal.

So far, all features behave as expected. Still, there are limitations as to the visual appearance and not including all the countries of the original dataset, and improvement could be made. One possible change is to add colored header for the overall title of the dashboard. Another improvement would be to place all the charts into cards for better appearance. We could also consider reworking the filters to allow for including all countries in the original dataset, even if they may not be present in the data for every single year.
