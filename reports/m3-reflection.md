# World Happiness Tracker App Dashboard Reflection (Milestone 3)

During the second milestone, our team managed to implement all of the proposed features with some changes (documented in `m2-reflection.md`), so, this week, we focused more on refinements.

One of the biggest problems with our dashboard is that it is aesthetically unappealing. During this milestone, we have decided to overhaul the color scheme (more yellow), font, title formats, and background color. Some more specific changes are:

- The key numbers have been rearranged into the order of: happiest, unhappiest, difference of maximum and minimum happiness score, and the median happiness score.
- The year selection widget has now been changed into a drop-down menu, to prevent giving off a false impression that it is a range.
- The line chart for the happiness over time now shows which year is being selected as the legend.
- Charts are now placed inside cards.
- We have also taken inspiration from group 18's Vancouver Airbnb Listings and added a navigation bar for our header. This bar will include some information about the team and clickable github icons for all the members.

Additionally, our source code has now been broken down into multiple files: preprocessing, layout-related functions, and server side.
