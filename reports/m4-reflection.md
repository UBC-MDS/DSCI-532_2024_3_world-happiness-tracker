# World Happiness Tracker App Dashboard Reflection (Milestone 4)

Dashboard vs. Original Sketch

When comparing the original sketch to the current dashboard, you'll notice a few key differences. The most notable is that the dashboard now has clearly defined colors, unlike the sketch. We decided to add color to make it aesthetically more pleasing overall.

The title has been shifted to the left side, and we've included buttons: an "About" button to provide an informative overview of the dashboard, and a "GitHub" button that links to our GitHub page. This makes the title more interactive.

The filters remain the same, with two country filters and a slider filter for the years. The next two visuals are split between the world map and the world ranking, as opposed to having a large world map with the ranking at the bottom. We made this change because the world map didn't significantly impact our filters, so we wanted to better display their use by spreading out the visuals. The bottom visuals remain the same, showing happiness over time and the factors contributing to happiness.

Advantages:
It captures the essence of being easy to use for high school students. The visuals and filters are very intuitive, and the changes are automatic. For educational purposes, this provides a tool that can be used to gain a good understanding of world happiness.

Limitations:
We cannot filter many countries (more than two) because this would be computationally expensive, so we do not implement this feature. The map is rather limited, so unless you have a good understanding of geography, the country filters are not too obvious. Having a better visual that includes geography without needing prior knowledge would be an improvement.

Possible Additions:
Instead of merging five datasets from different years, we could use the year filter to access these datasets individually, making the dashboard more accurate. We can add an additional filter for countries to provide even more options. However, I would not recommend adding more than three filters as this could become visually confusing. We could include an option to keep a global average in the filter, allowing for easier comparisons between countries and the global average.
